# After Hours Coding

This repository is my after-hours coding playground! Here you'll find a collection of personal projects I'm working on to unwind, explore new programming concepts, and keep my coding skills sharp.

Feel free to delve into the code, experiment on your own, and even contribute your after-hours coding creations!

What you'll find:

Programming playground: This repository is a mix of programming languages, whatever sparks my coding fancy after a long day.
Focus on learning and fun: These projects are not aimed at solving work problems, but rather at trying out new ideas, having some coding fun, and keeping my brain ticking.
Documentation (where applicable): I'll try my best to include clear comments and explanations within the code, especially for more complex projects.
